    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players,team);
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 =  players.slice();
    team[2] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team2);
    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[4] = 'AAAAAaa';
    console.log(players,team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

     
    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = Object.assign({},person,{number: 99, age: 12})
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 1000,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    // We can make a copy like
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // This is only one level deep
    // To clone the object completely, use:
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
