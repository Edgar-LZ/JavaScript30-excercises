# JavaScript30 Excercises

This repository contains the exercises for the JavaScript30 course, created by Wes Bos.

In the folders you can find the files with -FINISHED in their name.
These files are the examples provided by the author for the course. 

The files with -START in their name are the replicated files that I edited to follow the course.

You can find the course at:
